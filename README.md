## What?

This is a list of website domain names which meet the following criteria:

- Registration: The domain must be registered by "The City of Columbus", meaning:
	- the government of the City of Columbus,
	- or a department or subdivision or agency thereof,
	- or the City Council or office thereof,
	- or a contractor or subcontractor on behalf of "The City of Columbus"
	- excluding independent agencies that overlap with the boundaries of the City of Columbus but whose existence is not engendered in Columbus' municipal code, such as:
		- organizations established or chartered under state law, such as the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission, Metro Parks, the Central Ohio Transit Agency,and Columbus City Schools
		- organizations funded by, but not chartered by, the City of Columbus
- Purpose: The domain must be for a service, program, or entity that is relevant to Columbus, but not if Columbus is only one of the municipalities relevant to that program.
- Domain: The domain name must be an effective second-level domain, meaning that it consists of a domain name plus an [effective top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Suffix_List), such as `columbus.gov`. This excludes:
	- Columbus-specific subdomains of third-party domains, such as dpu.360water.com and zone-in-columbus.hub.arcgis.com
	- Subdomains of Columbus-registered domains, such as `gis.columbus.gov` and `portal.columgus.gov`

## Why?

Because I saw a bunch of random URLs used in Columbus' official communiques, and got curious.
